## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Rust-cola, please report it via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/Opus-the-penguin/Rust-cola/security/advisories/new).

This is an open source project maintained by volunteers. We'll do our best to respond, but cannot guarantee timelines.

## Scope

In scope:
- `cargo-cola` CLI and `mir-extractor` library

Out of scope:
